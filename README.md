# VEXA

Project based on [TCA architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture). 
Production ready samples can be found in [isowords](https://github.com/pointfreeco/isowords).

Every feature is separate package. Core packages have own Readme with a description. Feel free to read them :)
